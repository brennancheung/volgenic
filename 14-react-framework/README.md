# React + Immer + IDE

## Motivation

After some thought, I decided to see if I couldn't have the same advantages
of what I created in the previous experiments but with React.

React has a huge ecosystem and tons of libraries I can use.  I don't want
to give that up lightly.  The Immer library should help me overcome the
issues of updating deeply nested state.

Server-side sync can be done with the addition of a library I can develop
that is similar to Immer.

The AST might be a little more complicated to generated since it is a React
app and I might have to work around the React ecosystem and tooling a little
bit but I think it should be doable.

## Requirements

* Store a list of components to be rendered in a declarative data structure.
* Render the components.
* Expose properties that can be set for each component.
* Show overlays around the components in the IDE on hover and selection.
* Show a property inspector for the active component.
