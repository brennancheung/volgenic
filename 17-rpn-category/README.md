# Fusebox + RPN + Category Theory

## Motivation

I want to experiment with combining category theory + interactive IDE + RPN.

The idea of an object and a morphism leading to another object seems an ideal
fit for a RPN based IDE.  From personal experience I found RPN environments
highly productive and much easier to use than traditional calculators.

By restricting all my API's and functionality to be category theory centric
and composable I should quickly build software and achieve power that is
not possible in other languages / environments.

I also want to learn how to use Fusebox since it seems like it might be
more flexible, faster, and easier to use than the traditional Webpack + Babel.

Actually trying to compose things with category theory instead of just reading
will also help cement my knowledge as well as give me new insights.

## Requirements

* Get a new environment set up with Fusebox.
* Objects should have types.
* Allow pushing objects onto a stack.
* Allow morphisms to transform objects.
