# Volgenic

Volgenic is a new programming paradigm I'm experimenting with.


## The Basic Ideas

* Build and manipulate programs in their AST form.
* A stream of characters (source code) is an inefficient way to edit an AST.
* Each small use case in programming has more optimal representations and less
optimal representations.
* Reading code and writing code might better be accomplished in different
modalities and even different representations.
