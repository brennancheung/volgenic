# In-browser realtime transpilation

## Motivation

My long term vision is to have an in-browser editor that has its own AST that
compiles down to the actual program.

I have decided that LLVM is too low level so I will stick with JS and Babel
for now.

This experiment is a POC of creating a Babel AST, compiling it, and reloading
it all from within the browser.
