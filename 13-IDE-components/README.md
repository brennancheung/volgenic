# IDE Components

## Motivation

This experiment aims to discover the architectural patterns needed to build
an IDE that allows for dynamic components to be manipulated in a browser-based
IDE.

I'm more concerned with the rendering and architectural aspects but if I might
implement more of the UX depending on where things end up.

## Requirements

* Store a list of components to be rendered in a declarative data structure.
* Render the components.
* Expose properties that can be set for each component.
* Show overlays around the components in the IDE on hover and selection.
* Show a property inspector for the active component.
